                        Drawing digitally can be kind of disorienting for me. My brain simply makes better sense of
                        things
                        when
                        I'm holding a paintbrush and making a mess of my clothes with paint. I'm sure I'll make sense of
                        it
                        someday.

                        Even though I'm not overly thrilled about the way this piece came out, I still get really happy
                        looking
                        at it. I enjoyed the process. That's what it's all about, at the end of the day.

                <p class="piece-text2">I knew I wanted to take a more comedic approach, and drew inspiration for my
                    script
                    from skits done
                    by YouTuber Drew Gooden. I then shot half the ad in front of a greenscreen, and the other half in
                    the comfort of my own home. When editing, I thought it may add to the comedic tone I wanted if I had
                    a background with an obvious watermark.</p>

                    <p>When presenting our ads, we also had to create pitch slides to present in addition to our ad.
                        Unfortunately, my pitch deck has been lost to the cruel fate of being deleted alongside my
                        public
                        school email. Tragic.</p>
                    <p>For what it's worth, despite the numerous quality pitches with genuine product ideas my
                        classmates
                        brought, it seemed my silly approach was appreciated by my peers as I was voted to win second
                        place
                        after the pitches. I recieved a prize of three toy Paw Patrol cars my teacher found at
                        Mastermind
                        Toys. I still have them. For whatever reason.</p>
